# 🛒 BigMart Sales Prediction Challenge

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains my solution for the BigMart Sales Prediction challenge.

The objective is to predict sales for various products across different stores, using historical sales data and outlet/product attributes.
The project focuses on handling missing data, feature engineering, and building powerful regression models to optimize prediction accuracy.

## 🔍 Key Steps Followed
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    - Identified missing values, distribution patterns, and anomalies.

- 🛠️ Feature Engineering

    - Outlet age, visibility mean ratio, broad item categories, fat content standardization, etc.

- 🤖 Modeling

    - Started with Random Forest.

    - Enhanced model with XGBoost Regressor.

    - Validation via RMSE metric.

- 🚀 Submission

    - Generated final predictions for test dataset.

## 💬 Reflections
This project was a wonderful blend of technical skills, business understanding, and creative thinking.
It was incredibly satisfying to watch small improvements in feature engineering translate into measurable gains in prediction accuracy!

“In data science, curiosity and persistence are our greatest assets.” ✨
